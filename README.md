# UVa solutions
This is a collection of my solutions of problems at http://uva.onlinejudge.org/ <br>
This list is *incomplete*. I will upload my solutions as I solve more problems. <br>

Please note that this is not my standard coding style, this is the one I only use for competitive programming.

All of them have been solved by Pedro Palacios
